# BetaPilot 4.0 for Copter, BetaPlane

This is the BetaPilot fork of the ArduPilot project, for Plane.

I use it for developing new features, mainly related to the [STorM32 gimbal controller](http://www.olliw.eu/2013/storm32bgc/) project.

COMMENT: This branch is only tested on the workbench, but not yet flight tested !!!

## Usage and Release Notes ##

Please see http://www.olliw.eu/storm32bgc-wiki/Using_STorM32_with_ArduPilot for information on the usage and features of BetaPilot/BetaPlane.


## Build, Compile Notes ##

In order to build BetaPilot 4.0, do this:

- Follow the instructions in the ArduPilot wiki for installing the build environment.
- Clone this fork and checkout the BetaCopter branch.
- Ensure that all git submodules are there. Run git submodule update --init -- recursive.
- Copy the file \mavlink_withmostbasicadditions\common.xml to the folder ardupilot\modules\mavlink\message_definitions\v1.0. This will overwrite the file existing there. (This step is crucuial since ArduPilot doesn't support the latest MAVLink standard).
